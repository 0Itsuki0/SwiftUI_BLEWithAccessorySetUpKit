#  SwiftUI: AccessorySetupKit + BLE


A demo of paring and connecting with BLE accessories using AccessorySetUpKit.

specifically, this repository includes 
- a simple app that act as a BLE accessory (peripheral side), and 
- an app for setting up the accessory and communicating with it using AccessorySetUpKit and Core Bluetooth (Central Side).

To test out the sample app, get two real devices, one running the BLE accessory app, and another one running the main app.
